# Mailspring Solarized Dark Theme

A dark Mailspring theme inspired by Ethan Schoonover's Solarized color palette.

Modified in this fork to have a better mail message item border (instead of that ugly orange) and more closely mirror Solarized Dark colors.

## Install

1. Clone or download the project.

2. Open Mailspring and install the theme by going to `Mailspring > Install New Theme...` and selecting the directory containing this file.
